# Singly Linked List â€“ Basic Operations (C)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This program demonstrates **basic operations on a singly linked list** in C, including:
- Creating a linked list
- Counting the number of nodes
- Traversing and displaying the list

It uses a `Node` structure (defined in `Linklist.h`) with `data` and `next` fields, along with dynamic memory allocation for node creation.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **CreateNode**: Creates a single node with user input.
- **CreateList**: Builds a linked list by repeatedly creating nodes until the user stops.
- **CountNodes**: Counts the total number of nodes in the list.
- **Traverse**: Prints all elements of the list.

- Dynamic memory allocation using malloc
- Singly linked list operations
- Pointer manipulation
